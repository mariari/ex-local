* Local Upload
We provide a web server for uploading images.

Currently all we wish to support is local uploading

** Getting Started

- Run ~mix setup~ to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with ~mix phx.server~ or inside IEx with ~iex -S mix phx.server~

Now you can visit [[http://localhost:4000]] from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [[https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html][check the deployment guides]].
