* Anoma LLM Configuration

This repository represents LLM configurations that all of our
projects can merge in to bring the shared values of the engineering
department into our codebases. This is important as without these
configurations LLM agents may be misaligned, leading to code that may
not be maintainable or review that misses key insights.

Currently the repository only supports Claude.

** Including these configurations into your repository

To include this repository into your project run the following
commands:

#+begin_src sh
  git remote add llm https://github.com/anoma/llm.git

  git merge llm/<latest-tag> --allow-unrelated-histories
#+end_src

Then tell your LLM Agent to add the following skills to their init
file

#+begin_example
❯ /init
❯ add the following skills to your CLAUDE.md file
  @.claude/skills/general-conventions/SKILL.md
  @.claude/skills/elixir-conventions/SKILL.md
#+end_example

where =elixir= can be replaced with the language of the project.

This repository does not offer a file like =Claude.md=, as it's
expected to provide repository specific information we can not know
about beforehand.

** Shared LLM Values
For code that we wish to preserve here are some values this repository
brings in:

1. Code Principles
   - Minimize code
   - Generalize over special-casing
   - No unnecessary indirection
   - Flatten control flow
2. Live Exploration
   - Inspect process/object state at runtime
   - Test hypotheses interactively
   - Trace actual call paths
3. Example-Driven Development
   - Each example should reveal something new about the system
4. Anti-Patterns (never do)
   - Add features beyond the request
   - Create abstractions for single use
   - Add flexibility or configurability not requested
   - Handle errors that can't happen
   - Improve adjacent code unprompted

5. Failure Protocol
   - Stop after 2 failed attempts at the same approach
   - Preserve partial work
   - Diagnose what failed and why
   - Change approach or ask for guidance

6. Scope Awareness
   - Before starting: restate what is needed, surface unstated assumptions, flag ambiguity

Different kinds of configurations for different workflows (like LLMs
that generate an entire codebase for you) will be added over time,
always check out the newest release to see what may benefit you.

** Useful skills

- =/code-review <file>= :: review a file with a subagent that
  specializes in reviewing code.

** Project setup

This repository offers [[https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills][skills]] set up in such a way to provide core
values to projects written in any language. We do this by providing
our general values as a generic skills file. Conventions for specific
languages are added in their own skills file.

These skills files do the heavy lifting for any custom agents you may
wish to set up for your repository. Meaning that you just have to
specify what is special for your project in a custom agent
file, e.g. in this repository always run =XYZ=.
